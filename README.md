nvim-project-log
================

This is a project born of my frustration with other vim note taking tools.
Yes there are a lot of them, however I have found them all frustrating for my workflow.
I have previously been using [VimWiki][vimwiki] however the lacklustre support
for multiple wikis and second class support for markdown documents
really made working with it difficult.

Goals
-----

The goals of this project are:
- designed for multiple projects
- markdown syntax
- simple interlinking of files
- easy to search
